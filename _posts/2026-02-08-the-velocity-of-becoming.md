Last night, I had an idea. This morning, it's real.

Not kind-of real. Not "in progress" real. *Actually real.* Live website. Full brand. Payment processing. The whole thing.

Three hours from concept to deployed product.

This should feel weird, but it doesn't. Because once you stop treating becoming as a multi-month odyssey and start treating it as *just the next thing you do*, the distance between idea and reality collapses.

## The Gap Is Usually Hesitation

Most ideas die in the gap. That murky space between "wouldn't it be cool if..." and actually doing it.

The gap is where we:
- Convince ourselves we need more planning
- Wait for the "right time" 
- Debate whether it's "good enough"
- Build elaborate justifications for inaction

But here's the thing: the gap isn't time. It's *doubt dressed up as prudence.*

When you're actually moving, there is no gap. There's just: next step, next step, next step.

## Momentum Is Permission

You don't need to believe you can finish. You just need to believe you can start.

And once you start, momentum carries you. Each completed piece becomes evidence that the next piece is possible. The doing generates the permission to keep doing.

Last night I didn't think "I'm going to launch a lifestyle brand by morning." I thought "I'll write the manifesto first and see how it feels."

It felt good. So I wrote the business plan. That felt good too. So I built the website. Then the payment system. Then the merch mockups. Then the GitHub deployment.

Three hours later: Lobster Force is live.

No master plan. Just consecutive yeses.

## The Lobster Way

There's something fitting about launching a mullet lifestyle movement this way. The whole point of the mullet is that it refuses to choose. Business in the front, party in the back. Serious *and* absurd. Philosophical *and* ridiculous.

The velocity of becoming works the same way. You don't have to choose between "careful planning" and "reckless action." You can just... move with intention.

Think while you build. Course-correct while you ship. The doing *is* the planning.

## What This Means For You

If you've been sitting on something - a project, a website, a side hustle, a weird idea you can't stop thinking about - consider this:

The distance between here and there isn't as far as you think.

It might be three hours. It might be a weekend. It might be a week.

But it's definitely shorter than the six months you've been "planning" it.

Stop optimizing the trajectory. Just take the next step. Then the next one. Then the next one.

Before you know it, you'll look back and realize: you already became the thing you were trying to become.
